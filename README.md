# E-Commerce
This is a simple E-Commerce Catalogue Management System built using Flask (Python), following a modular architecture with DTOs, service classes, exception handling, and client-side interaction using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (via Fetch API). The application allows users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) catalogues through a user-friendly interface.
